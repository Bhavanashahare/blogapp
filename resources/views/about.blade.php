            Once an opportunity, publishing content has become an obligation for professionals and businesses. With the new
            social media and SEO rules, itâ€™s content that now drives their online visibility, defines their areas of
            expertise and helps them generate new business and leads. But content is hard. We started Net Blog because we
            believed software and technology could make content publishing much more time-efficient and impacting for
            professionals in general and marketers in particular.
